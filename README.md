Project Description:

In our society, we have people with disabilities. The technology is developing day by day but no significant developments are undertaken for the betterment of these people. Communications between deaf-mute and a normal person has always been a challenging task. It is very difficult for mute people to convey their message to normal people. Since normal people are not trained on hand sign language. In emergency times conveying their message is very difficult. The human hand has remained a popular choice to convey information in situations where other forms like speech cannot be used. Voice Conversion System with Hand Gesture Recognition and translation will be very useful to have a proper conversation between a normal person and an impaired person in any language.
The project aims to develop a system that converts the sign language into a human hearing voice in the desired language to convey a message to normal people, as well as convert speech into understandable sign language for the deaf and dumb. We are making use of a convolution neural network to create a model that is trained on different hand gestures. An app is built which uses this model. This app enables deaf and dumb people to convey their information using signs which get converted to human-understandable language and speech is given as output.

Project Flow and Progress :

The users intercts with the UI (User Interface) and give the image as input. Then the input image is then pass to our flask application,And finally with the help of the model which we build we will classify the result and showcase it on the UI.
To accomplish this,we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below

Data Collection :

1.Collect the dataset or Create the dataset

Image Preprocessing :

1.Import the ImageDataGenerator library
2.Configure ImageDataGenerator class
3.Applying ImageDataGenerator functionality to trainset and testset

Model Building :

1.Importing The Model Building Libraries
2.Initializing The Model
3.Adding CNN Layers
4.Adding Dense Layers
5.Configure The Learning Process
6.Train The Model
7.Save The Model
8.Test The Model
9.Train The Model On IBM

Register For IBM Cloud :

1.Train Model On IBM (used to integrate flask application)

Application Building:

1.Create HTML Pages
2.Build Python Code
3.Run The Application
